thanks guys, we said, and turned back to our work.

 we packed up our violin crates, and a few short songs tumbled out, but they weren't anything to send your parents a letter describing. we took the crates to the warehouse and put 'em over there, near a few tubs with carp, bass, and walleye salmon. these tubs were under a scaffolding with several spots for rifle mounts, and even a little chute to catch the excess cartridge shells. 

it's harder than it sounds.
